# CS601 - Assignment 2: Drag-and-Drop Matching Game

## 📄 Project Description
This interactive web application allows users to drag and drop items into the appropriate category (Fruits or Vegetables). The data is loaded asynchronously from a remote JSON source using the Fetch API. As users sort the items correctly, the interface responds dynamically, and a final congratulatory message appears when all items are correctly matched.

## 🧪 How to Run
1. **Start a Local Server**: Since Fetch will not work from the file system (`file://`), open the project using a local server. You can use:

   - **VS Code + Live Server Extension** (Recommended)
   - or run `npx http-server` from the terminal in the project directory

2. Open the browser at `http://localhost:<PORT>` and test the drag-and-drop functionality.

3. Drag each item into the appropriate category box (Fruits or Vegetables).

4. Once all items are correctly sorted, a congratulatory message will appear.

## JSON Source
The JSON file is served via a CORS-friendly proxy:
```
